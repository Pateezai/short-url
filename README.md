# Shortener
This project is the beginning of URL Shortener website practice start with using MongoDB, Express and Nodejs 

The idea is that normally usual url-shortener websites are only provide the auto-generated path 
which mean if you shorten some url you'll get something(path) like "www.example.com/ArUfD5" where "ArUfD5" is an auto-generated path.
So i'm come up with the idea that "How about we can custom our own path?" That's why in our website have a custom box for customize
the path name.
